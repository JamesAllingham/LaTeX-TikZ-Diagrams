# Receptive Fields in CNNs

## About

This is a diagram I made for the 2019 Deep Learning Indaba [practical on CNNs](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2019/blob/master/3a_conv_nets.ipynb). I wanted to illustrate how kernel size, pooling layers, and stacking successive layers can increase the effective receptive field size of a CNN. The receptive field of an output node is highlighted in purple.
