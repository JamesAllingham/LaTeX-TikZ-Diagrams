## About

This is an alternative weight sharing diagram I made for the 2019 Deep Learning Indaba [practical on CNNs](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2019/blob/master/3a_conv_nets.ipynb). I wanted to illustrate how kernel size, pooling layers, and stacking successive layers can increase the effective receptive field size of a CNN. For this version I wanted to show these effects in 2D.
