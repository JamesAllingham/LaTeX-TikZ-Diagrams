# Weight Sharing in CNNs

## About

This is a diagram I made for the 2019 Deep Learning Indaba [practical on CNNs](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2019/blob/master/3a_conv_nets.ipynb). I wanted to illustrate the fact that a convolution layer can have many fewer parameters than a fully-connected layer with the same input and output sizes. Here the input and output nodes are depicted with blue and red circles, respectively, while the weights are the lines between them. The colours of the lines represent the values of the weights.
