# LaTeX-TikZ-Diagrams

Here you can find (just about) all of the diagrams I've ever made in LaTeX using TikZ (and Pgfplots) [WIP].

This is more for my reference than anything, and might not be useful for anyone else at all, but I learned to make these diagrams from example so maybe these will help someone doing the same thing. 

The resource I used most when learning was [TeXample.net](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/), which has hundreds of TikZ and PGF examples. 

Another great resource for anyone who is starting out is the [Overleaf guide for LaTeX graphics](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/LaTeX_Graphics_using_TikZ:_A_Tutorial_for_Beginners_(Part_1)%E2%80%94Basic_Drawing).

The [Wikibooks page for TikZ and PGF](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/PGF/TikZ) is also pretty good.

## Disclaimer

Some of these diagrams are very poorly done! Especially the earlier ones. They don't take full advantage of many of the powerful features of TikZ, such as `\foreach` and the `calc` package. However, I think they are still useful as examples for how to do simple things in TikZ and will be good enough for 90% of cases. If you are wanting to make complex diagrams you should probably look at my more recent work.

Furthermore, I will not be updating old diagrams! The only exception will be to make sure they compile on Overleaf.

## Organization

Since my earlier work is generally of poorer quality, I'm organizing the diagrams by `year` then `category`. Where examples of categories include flow, neural networks, and circuit diagrams. You can also find links to all the diagrams in this table, along with the year, category and a star rating out of 3 representing roughly how well I think the diagram was made.
